# Data
    Data is about the transactions for an e commerce company for a period of 1 year. Data contained information at the transaction level for each transaction it has the demographics of the customer, data about the product, discount information according to the month and product category and gst applied on each product category.

# Objective
The main objective of the project was to drive important information about customers and the patterns hidden in the the transaction to reduce costumer churn and increase sales.
* I have to find the **customer churn and the retention rate**. For this **Cohort Analysis** was performed on monthly basis and various questions were answered using eda.
* I also have to analyse the effect of marketing spend on the sales.
* **Customer Segmentation** to better understand and divide the customers in certain categories, so that we can initiate targeted campaign, is also performed using Heuristic approach of RFM and also using ML approach of KMeans
* One of the task was to suggest better approach for cross selling. I performed market basket analysis to better understand the products that were selling together and for this, I used Market Basket Analysis
* Customer lifetime value is a very important attribute about the customer and its a good approach to assess it beforehand and target cuustomers as per the class they are in. For this I classified customers in Low, Medium and High value customers and build a classification model.
* Another task was to predict the next purchase day of the customer, using four classes 0-30 days, 30-60 days, 60-90 days, 90+ days to achieve this task I built classification models and also assessed the features that were important for the classification.
